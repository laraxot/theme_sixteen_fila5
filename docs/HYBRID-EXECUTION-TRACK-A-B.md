## 📋 TRACK A: HTML BLOCKER REMEDIATION

### Executor #2 Workflow

**Step 1: Prepare** (5 min)
- Read PHASE-1-DECISION-BLOCKERS.md
- Review report.md (12 blockers + 14 flags)
- Understand each issue and fix approach
- Plan blade modifications

**Step 2: Fix Header Issues** (5 min)
- Issue 1-2: Add missing `<span>` children to button in header slim zone
- Modification: laravel/Themes/Sixteen/resources/views/pages/tests/[slug].blade.php

**Step 3: Fix Navigation Issues** (10 min)
- Issue 3: Add `<div class="it-search-wrapper">` to nav
- Issue 4-5: Add `<div id="nav4">` wrapper
- Issue 7: Fix navbar toggle (button vs div)
- Multiple fixes to nav section structure

**Step 4: Fix Main Element Issues** (15 min)
- Issue 6-9: Restructure main content
- Ensure main has 4 children (not 1)
- Fix children count for rows and columns
- Multiple structural changes

**Step 5: Add Missing Bottom Sections** (10 min)
- Issue 10: Add `<div class="bg-primary">` section (CTA)
- Issue 11: Add `<div class="bg-grey-card shadow-contacts">` section (Contacts)
- Issue 12: Add `<div class="it-example-modal">` section (Modal)
- These are CRITICAL - page is incomplete without them

**Step 6: Build & Test** (5 min)
```bash
cd laravel/Themes/Sixteen
npm run build
npm run copy
# Test locally at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/it/tests/segnalazioni-elenco
```

**Step 7: Verify** (5 min)
- Manually check page structure
- Verify no console errors
- Ensure all sections visible
- Ready for Subtask 5 re-verification

## 📊 TRACK B: PHASE 2 RESEARCH & STRATEGY

### Research Agents Running in Parallel

**Agent 1: Design Comuni CSS/JS Architecture**
- Extract design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
- Analyze component-specific styling
- Understand JavaScript behavior patterns
- Document responsive design approach

**Agent 2: FixCity Sixteen Current Setup**
- Map CSS/SCSS directory structure
- Document JavaScript setup
- Review current design tokens (if any)
- Analyze build process

**Agent 3: CSS/JS Best Practices**
- Research modern CSS techniques
- Bootstrap customization patterns
- Form styling approaches
- Performance optimization strategies

### Researcher Workflow (Parallel with Track A)

**While waiting for research agents**:

1. Monitor Track A progress
2. Prepare Phase 2 strategy framework (already created: PHASE-2-STRATEGY-FRAMEWORK.md)
3. Ready template documents for Phase 2 execution
4. Prepare coordination for when research agents complete

**When research agents complete** (should be ~15-20 min):
1. Read all 3 research outputs
2. Synthesize into Phase 2 Strategy Document
3. Create design tokens specification
4. Outline CSS/JS execution plan
