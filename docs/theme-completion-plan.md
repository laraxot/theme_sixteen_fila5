# Theme Completion Plan

## Current Status Analysis

After reviewing the documentation, I've identified a discrepancy in the component implementation status. While `analisi-completa-tema.md` indicates 55/54 components are implemented (102% complete), it also lists 37 components as "pending implementation." This inconsistency needs to be resolved.

## Components to Implement

Based on the documentation, the following components need to be implemented:

### Priority 1
1. **Tab System**
   - Vertical/horizontal tabs
   - Responsive behavior
   - State management

2. **Accordion**
   - Nested support
   - Accessibility features
   - Animation controls

3. **Dropdown**
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Mobile support
   - ARIA attributes

### Priority 2
4. **Datepicker**
5. **Range Slider**
6. **Tooltip System**
7. **Toast Notifications**
8. **File Upload**
9. **Rating System**

## Implementation Plan

I will implement these components in order of priority, starting with the Priority 1 components. For each component, I will:

1. Study the AGID guidelines for the component
2. Create the necessary Blade templates
3. Implement the required JavaScript functionality
4. Add appropriate styles
5. Ensure accessibility compliance
6. Write comprehensive documentation
7. Update the component status in the documentation

## Documentation Updates

I will maintain and update the following documentation files:

1. `components-status.md` - To track the implementation status of all components
2. Create individual documentation files for each component in the `components/` directory
3. Update `theme-completion-plan.md` with progress reports

All documentation will follow these rules:
- All filenames and directory names will be lowercase
- The only exception is README.md
- All documentation will be in English
- Documentation will include usage examples, accessibility considerations, and customization options

## Implementation Timeline

| Component | Estimated Completion |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Tab System | Day 1 |
| Accordion | Day 1 |
| Dropdown | Day 1 |
| Datepicker | Day 2 |
| Range Slider | Day 2 |
| Tooltip System | Day 2 |
| Toast Notifications | Day 3 |
| File Upload | Day 3 |
| Rating System | Day 3 |

## Progress Tracking

I will update this document with progress reports as components are implemented.
