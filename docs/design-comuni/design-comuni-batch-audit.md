# Design Comuni Batch Structure Audit

Generated: 2026-04-03T10:29:03+00:00

| Page | JSON | Local | Body % | Main % | CSS/JS Gate |
|------|------|-------|--------|--------|-------------|
| `argomenti` | yes | renders | 90 | 83 | BLOCKED |

## Notes

- `READY` means local page renders and top-level `main` children match the reference at least 90% with this coarse audit.
- `BLOCKED` means missing JSON, runtime error, or structural mismatch that should be fixed before CSS/JS parity work.
